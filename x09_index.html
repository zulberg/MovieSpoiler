    <h2>Movie Quote</h2>
    <p>"Today, you will once again be fighting for our freedom... Not from tyranny, oppression, or persecution... but from annihilation. And<br>
       should we win the day, the Fourth of July will no longer be known as an American holiday, but as the day when the world declared in one<br>
       voice: "We will not go quietly into the night!" We will not vanish without a fight! We're going to live on! We're going to survive!<br>
       Today we celebrate our INDEPENDENCE DAY!" --President Whitmore</p>
    <h2>Plot</h2>

       An all-out assault ensued, the alien mothership was destroyed, and the aliens were defeated.  Now, 20 years later, the alien threat has<br>
       returned. The alien queen had somehow escaped the mothership's destruction and returned to their homeworld.  David Levinson, now<br>
       a top notch researcher, discovered a distress signal coming from one of the downed alien ships.  Their call for help was answered...</p>
